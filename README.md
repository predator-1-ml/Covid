# Covid Classification and Opacification using Transfer Learning

The application of computer vision technology to detect and classify this virus from a chest
X-ray picture can be a very valuable addition to the less sensitive traditional method of detecting COVID-19, namely reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
This automated technique has the potential to improve on current COVID-19 treatment methods while also alleviating the scarcity of skilled physicians in rural areas. Again, segmenting diseased regions from a chest X-ray picture can aid medical practitioners in gaining insight into the afflicted area. So, in this research, we employed a deep learning-based transfer learning
approach for CT-scan and X-ray image classification, and a U-Net architecture for segmentation to segment the afflicted region. On the available X-ray dataset, 99.7% classification
accuracy was obtained, 99.4% on the available CT-scan dataset, and 87% average accuracy
from the segmentation process.
